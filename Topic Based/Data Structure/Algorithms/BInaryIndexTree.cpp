        // (9 - 12) tree[12] needs that value. As by tree[12] we basically mean it has all the 4 values left of it. and for 12 we need to update 16 as well

        // (1100 / 8 + 4) this will take 4th integer left from it i.e 8 then 8 will take the rest. This way it convers the whole array.

// Any number can be represented as summations of power of two. For example 7 = 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0. Now if we want to have the sum of all the elements from index
// 1 to index 7 we can add 7th index's value and the n 6 - 5 and then 4 - 1. This will serve our perpoose. If we take a closer look at the intervals between
// them (7 - 7 + 1) = 1, (6 - 5 + 1) = 2 = 2^1. (4 - 1 + 1) = 4 = 2^2 which is in another word is the represntation of the binary representation of 7.

// WHY DO WE NEED IT? Let's say there is an array now we need to find the sum between l and r. Simple prefix array would do right? What if values are updated
// in the interval then? going through l to r again and again in t cases..
